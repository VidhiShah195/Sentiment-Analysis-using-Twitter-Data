## Sentiment-Analysis-using-Twitter-Data

# Problem and Dataset 
The primary aim of the current study is to solve the problem of emotion detection by performing sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique used to decipher the emotional tone of text. In this case, the tone or sentiment categories analyzed are either positive or negative and the dataset is composed of data from Twitter. There are many applications for this study. For example, businesses may want to monitor the online feedback they are getting to make data-driven decisions, or brands may want to monitor their public opinion by analyzing online information. In the digital age, social media plays a huge role in marketing and businesses can receive direct feedback now more than ever. Understanding how to access and process this information is a huge asset for companies. For companies to truly gain an understanding of customer opinions and respond to market demands, this study, with the use of sentiment analysis, allows further insight than company-elicited feedback forms alone.
The dataset originally contained 74,996 tweets, each with four attributes: tweet ID, entity, sentiment, and the tweet content. The dataset was pre-split into a training and testing set, with 1000 rows belonging to the test subset and the rest in the training subset. The sentiment column contained “Positive”, “Negative”, “Neutral” and “Irrelevant”. To start the data cleaning process, both the “Neutral” and “Irreverent” rows were dropped. In this step, a total of 31,308 rows were dropped from the training set and 438 rows were dropped from the testing set. Next any null values were dropped from the dataset. Only the tweet content column contained null values. A total of 686 values were dropped from the training set and none from the testing set. At this time, the data set was clean and ready to process for the models, resulting in a total of 43,506 entries left in the data set: 43,506 rows in the testing set and 493 rows in the testing set. Figure 1, below, shows the value counts of each sentiment across the dataset. To prepare the data for the modeling stage of this project, “Positive” sentiment was encoded as 1, and “Negative” sentiment was encoded as 0. Neither the tweet “id” nor “entity” columns are used in the model. The tweet content is our feature variable with the tweet content as our binary target variable.
